#Program for plagarism checker in python:
#Using file handling:

#Creating function for store data in file:

def plagarism():
  a = str(input("Enter your answer (a): "))
  b = str(input("Enter your answer (b): "))
  
#Add data in file:  

  file = open("a.txt","w")
  file.write (a)
  file.write (",")
  file.close()
  file =  open("b.txt","w")
  file.write (b)
  file.write (",")
  file.close()
  print("Your answers are saved")
  read()          #Calling function which do operations:    

#Create function for fetch data in the file:

def read(): 
  file1 = open("a.txt","r")
  file2 = open("b.txt","r")
  for a in file1:                    
    for b in file2:     

      if a==b:
        print("You cheated, Write another answer")
        return plagarism()
      elif a!=b:
        print("Thank you for your responses")
      else:
